## ⚡ Usage  
Launch it, aim it, fire it. Here’s how.

### GUI Version (fbscamblaster_gui.py)  
For systems with a display (Kali, or Termux with VNC).

#### On Kali Linux  
1. **Start Tor**  
   Go dark:  
   ```bash  
   sudo service tor start  
   ```  
2. **Run the Tool**  
   Unleash the GUI:  
   ```bash  
   python3 fbscamblaster_gui.py  
   ```

#### On Termux (with VNC)

   ```bash  
   pkg install -y tigervnc xfce4  
   ```  
2. **Start VNC Server**  
   ```bash  
   vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x720  
   ```  
3. **Set Display**  
   ```bash

#### On Termux  
1. **Start Tor**  
   Run it silent:

   tor &>/dev/null &  
   ```  
   (Optional ping: `termux-toast "Tor is active"`)  
2. **Run the Tool**  
   Bring the pain:  
   ```bash  
   python3 fbscamblaster_cli.py  
   ```

3. **Target Lock**  
   - Drop the scam URL (e.g., `https://facebook.com/scammy.profile`).  
   - Set report count (200 default—crank it up).  
   - Hit “Take ‘Em Down” (GUI) or Enter (CLI) and watch the live feed.

## ⚙️ Customization  
- **Endpoint Hunt**: `report_url` in the script is a dummy. Snag the real one with Burp Suite or dev tools on a manual report.  
- **Next Level**: CAPTCHA walls or rate limits? CHEEKY’s got upgrades—proxy pools, solvers, you name it.  
- **Heads-Up**: Built for education. Keep it smart.
